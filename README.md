# Radres Software 

Part of the updated Notion.so sequence to set up a remote access rig. Follow the steps below.

### Getting Started

You will need a USB thumb drive (or external drive), with more than 10GB of free space.

### Win 1909

You will need your own license/product key. Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kGxRIklx13lvDA9YhqhD5lSADLdJxrji/view?usp=sharing) and download this file to your thumb drive. Unzip it, and it will contain all of the necessary files to successfully install the correct OS.

### Remote Access Files

On the same thumb drive, make a separate folder called "Remote Access Files." Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19kaBtyrHXLtCTRtqsKsk_lMeHgUAi22U?usp=sharing) and download all of the files to your "Remote Access Files" folder. These will be available afterward on your thumb-drive/external disk. Alternatively, you can download the files from the Dropbox link.
